# Arduino Blinking LED Project

This is a simple Arduino project that demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Arduino board. The code provided in this repository will make an LED connected to pin 6 of the Arduino board blink on and off with a 100ms delay between each state change.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED (any color)
- 220-ohm resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable to connect the Arduino to your computer

## Wiring Diagram

Make the following connections on your breadboard:

- Connect the longer leg of the LED (the anode) to pin 6 on the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor.
- Connect the shorter leg of the LED (the cathode) to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

2. Open the `blink_led.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Make sure your Arduino board is connected to your computer via USB.

4. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

After uploading the code to your Arduino board, you should see the LED connected to pin 6 blinking on and off with a 100ms delay.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a fundamental introduction to Arduino programming and hardware interaction. Blinking an LED is often the "Hello World" equivalent in the Arduino world and is a great starting point for learning about digital output and basic control of electronic components. You can now build upon this knowledge to create more complex projects and explore the vast possibilities of Arduino development.

Happy tinkering!
